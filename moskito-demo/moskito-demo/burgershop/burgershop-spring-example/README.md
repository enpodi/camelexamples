burgershop-spring-example
==========

This small example demonstrates MoSKito integration for a simple java application. The example is based on spring but the concepts are same for every java web-application.
The example consists of 3 simple controllers and 2 services, one of them actually doing something.

To build the example use maven 3 and drop the war file into a servlet container (tomcat) of your choice.
