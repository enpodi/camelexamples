burgershop-call-execution
==========

This small example is similar to the Burgershop-Spring-Example (parallel project) but uses explicit measuring instead of the preferred aop-style.

## Do not use this as your first MoSKito example use Burgershop-Spring-Example instead.

It demonstrates MoSKito integration for a simple java application.
 
The example is based on spring but the concepts are same for every java web-application.
The example consists of 3 simple controllers and 2 services, one of them actually doing something.

To build the example use maven 3 and drop the war file into a servlet container (tomcat) of your choice.
